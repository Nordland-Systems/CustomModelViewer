###Custom Model Viewer
This plugin shows every custom model of a given Item by showing each Model for custom model ids from 0 to 243 (9 pages of 27 items)

THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT ADD CUSTOM MODELS! You need a resourcepack for that!
 

##Dependencies
Nothing ^^ just Spigot 1.16.5

 

##Usage
Simply use the command /cmv to see all Custom Item models of the item in your hand.

You can also use "/cmv <itemname> <page>" if you need more options (here you can even go beyond the 9th page)

 

#Modes
In the Custom Model Viewer you have a mode-toggler to switch how you get the item you're clicking on:

Inventory-Mode: You get the clicked Item in the next free Slot in your inventory

Hand-Mode: You get the clicked Item in your main Hand

Offhand-Mode: You get the clicked Item in your Offhand

Hat-Mode: You get the clicked Item on your Head

Drop-Mode: You drop the clicked Item in front of you (behind the inventory)

 

##Permissions
The plugin currently has two permissions which basically do the same:

custommodelviewer.* - allows all things in the custom model viewer
custommodelviewer.show - allows to show the custom model viewer
